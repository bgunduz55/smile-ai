# AI-Powered Code Completion for Smile AI

Smile AI now provides AI-powered code completion capabilities similar to GitHub Copilot or Cursor, enhancing your coding experience by offering smart suggestions as you type.

## Features

### 1. IntelliSense Code Completions
The extension offers AI-powered suggestions in the standard IntelliSense dropdown menu, triggered by various characters like `.`, `(`, `[`, etc. These suggestions are context-aware and based on your current code.

### 2. Inline (Ghost Text) Completions
Similar to Copilot, Smile AI can show inline "ghost text" completions as you type, allowing you to quickly accept multi-line code suggestions.

## Configuration

You can customize the code completion behavior in VS Code settings:

### Behavior Settings
- `smile-ai.behavior.autoComplete`: Enable/disable code completion (default: true)
- `smile-ai.behavior.inlineCompletion`: Enable/disable inline completions (default: true)
- `smile-ai.behavior.autoImport`: Automatically add imports for code completions when possible (default: true)

### Completion Settings
- `smile-ai.completion.maxTokens`: Maximum tokens to use for code completion requests (default: 100)
- `smile-ai.completion.temperature`: Temperature for completions - lower means more deterministic (default: 0.2)
- `smile-ai.completion.debounceTime`: Time to wait after typing before requesting completions (default: 300ms)

### Keyboard Shortcuts
- Accept suggestion: `Tab` (customizable via `smile-ai.shortcuts.acceptSuggestion`)
- Next suggestion: `Alt+]` (customizable via `smile-ai.shortcuts.nextSuggestion`)
- Previous suggestion: `Alt+[` (customizable via `smile-ai.shortcuts.previousSuggestion`)

## How It Works

1. As you type, Smile AI analyzes your code context
2. The AI model generates completions based on:
   - Current file content
   - Cursor position
   - Import statements
   - Project context (if available)
3. Suggestions appear either inline or in the IntelliSense dropdown

## Best Practices

- For best results, use clear and consistent coding patterns
- If completions aren't relevant, try typing more context
- The more detailed your code structure, the better the completions
- Consider adjusting the temperature setting:
  - Lower for more predictable completions
  - Higher for more creative suggestions

## Requirements

- An active AI provider configured in Smile AI settings
- Sufficient context in your code for meaningful completions

## Troubleshooting

If completions aren't working as expected:

1. Verify that code completion is enabled in settings
2. Check that your AI provider is correctly configured and responding
3. Try adjusting the completion settings
4. Restart VS Code if settings changes don't take effect
